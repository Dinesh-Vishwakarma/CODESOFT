## Guess The Number Game

**ABOUT**
This project is a Guess the Number game developed in Java as part of the CODESOFT internship program. The game is designed to test players' logical thinking and intuition by challenging them to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of rounds.

## Game Description 
The game begins by generating a random number between 0 and 99. The player chooses the number of rounds (between 1 and 10) to guess the correct number. Each guess is evaluated, and feedback is provided:

- If the guess is correct, the player wins.
- If the guess is too high, the game informs the player.
- If the guess is too low, the game gives a hint.
- If all rounds are used without a correct guess, the player loses

## Game Logic

The core logic of the game involves:
- Using Java's Random class to generate a number.
- Taking user input for the guess and comparing it with the generated number.
- Implementing conditional checks to provide feedback on each guess.
- Maintaining a score and displaying the final result.
